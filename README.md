# DiscordPomodoro

## For what ? 

This project aims to boost my productivity by implementing the well-known Pomodoro technique. I have decided to create a Discord bot, as Discord is a tool I particularly enjoy using. Ultimately, this bot should be capable of integration into existing Discord servers to allow students or other users to work together simultaneously using the Pomodoro method.

I will be using Discord.js to develop this project.
